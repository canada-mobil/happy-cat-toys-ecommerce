    contactUs: "Contact Us",
    q1: "Are your toys safe for my cat?",
    a1: "Absolutely! All our toys are made with non-toxic materials and tested for feline safety. We comply with the strictest Canadian standards and every product goes through rigorous quality controls.",
    q2: "How often should I change my cat's toys?",
    a2: "We recommend rotating toys every 1-2 weeks to maintain your cat's interest. Replace any damaged toy immediately. Our durable toys are designed to withstand intense play for months.",
    q3: "My cat isn't interested in new toys, what should I do?",
    a3: "That's normal! Try introducing the toy gradually, use catnip to attract them, or play with it yourself to show them. Some cats prefer to observe before playing. Be patient, it can take a few days.",
    q4: "Is catnip safe for all cats?",
    a4: "Yes, our organic catnip is 100% natural and safe. About 70% of cats are sensitive to it. It's not addictive and effects last 10-15 minutes. Just avoid giving it to kittens under 6 months.",
    q5: "Can I wash the plush toys?",
    a5: "Most of our plush toys can be hand-washed with warm water and mild soap. Let them dry completely before giving them back to your cat. Always check the product label for specific instructions.",
    q6: "How much playtime does my cat need per day?",
    a6: "Cats need 10-15 minutes of active play, 2-3 times a day. Kittens and young cats can play up to 30 minutes at a time. Play helps maintain a healthy weight and reduces destructive behavior.",
